<h2>Story</h2>


<p>Jimmy Vegas is fulfilling a lifelong ambition by going to Las Vegas and playing on the roulette table. He believes he has the solution which can beat the roulette table every time.</p>

<p>Jimmy has never seen a Red Black or Black Red pattern repeat itself more than four times; for example, Jimmy has never seen the following: ```Red, Black, Red, Black, Red``` or vice versa: ```Black, Red, Black, Red, Black```.</p>

If Jimmyâ€™s above theory is correct, he knows that if he sees the Red Black or Black Red pattern repeat itself four times then the pattern is certain to break!

For example:
```
(Red, Black, Red, Black > bets Black)

(Black, Red, Black, Red > bets Red)
```

Notice how he is betting that the above patterns did not continue?

The problem is that Jimmy has a very short attention span and he is worried that if, one of the two, above patterns appear, he will miss it and therefore not bet. Help Jimmy fulfil a lifelong ambition of winning millions in a Las Vegas casino by creating a function which will bet "Red" or "Black" appropriately in case he forgets to do it himself.






<p>Jimmy has a purse of $10 and the minimum bet is $1, work out how many spins it would take for Jimmy to lose all of his money if he used his RedBlack or BlackRed system.</p>

<p>It can be assumed Jimmy will only bet every time the (["Red", "Black", "Red", "Black"], bets "Black") or (["Black", "Red", "Black", "Red"], bets "Red") pattern apeears.</p>

<p>If Jimmy wins on a spin he receives $2.</p>
